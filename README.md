## 🚀 About Me  

I am a Computer Science engineer specializing in **Cybersecurity**, working at the intersection of **blockchain protocol engineering, cryptography, and Web3 infrastructure**.

I design and build **cryptocurrency networks, smart contract platforms, and enterprise-grade private blockchains**. I have **industry experience delivering private blockchain and cryptocurrency solutions for companies**, including **tokenized asset systems, internal ledgers, and secure transaction platforms**.

My work spans both **public blockchains and permissioned enterprise networks (Hyperledger Fabric)**, enabling **tamper-proof, auditable, and access-controlled distributed systems**.

I also specialize in **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**, encryption, hashing, and digital signature schemes to build **privacy-preserving, regulation-ready blockchain systems**.
