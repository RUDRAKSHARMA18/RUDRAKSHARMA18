## 🚀 About Me  

I am a Computer Science engineer specializing in **Cybersecurity**, focused on **blockchain protocol engineering, applied cryptography, distributed systems, and Web3 infrastructure**.

I design and build **cryptocurrency networks, token economies, smart contract platforms, and private blockchain systems**. I have **industry experience developing secure blockchain and cryptocurrency solutions for companies**, including **tokenized asset systems, internal financial ledgers, audit-grade transaction platforms, and decentralized identity frameworks**.

I work across **public blockchains and enterprise-grade private networks**, including **custom blockchain stacks and Hyperledger Fabric**, enabling **tamper-proof, permissioned, and regulation-ready distributed systems**.

I also develop **privacy-preserving cryptographic protocols using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**, Merkle trees, digital signatures, encryption schemes, and hashing to build **trustless systems where verification does not require data exposure**.

## 🔥 What I Build  

- Custom **Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchain protocols**  
- **Cryptocurrency systems** with tokenomics, fee markets, staking and governance  
- **Smart contract frameworks** and decentralized applications  
- **ZKP-based verification and privacy layers**  
- **Enterprise blockchain solutions** using Hyperledger Fabric  
- **Secure transaction, wallet, and identity infrastructure**
